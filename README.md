### Motivation:
We would like to improve our skills in software engineering by creating an application that can raise financial awareness at the same time. As full-time university students, we realised the importance of planning our finances to prevent ourselves from spending too much money before the month ends. It will help users to better control their spending habits and also track their progress towards a certain financial goal.

### User Stories:
* As application developers, we hope to learn from this experience and share what problems we faced in the process of making the web application.
* As users, we would like to be able to record and categorize our expenses into different categories.
* As users, we would like to be able to access our financial information in terms of visual representations such as charts or graphs to help us better visualize our spending patterns.

### Features:
1. Login and Signup feature (Completed)
2. Record and delete transactions made (Midway through)
